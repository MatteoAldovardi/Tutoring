    "**Problem 1: Sports Activity Frequency**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1a) Calculate Minimum, Maximum, Mean, and Median**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Minimum:** The minimum value is the smallest number of times students practice sports. In this case, it's 0.\n",
    "* **Maximum:** The maximum value is the largest number of times students practice sports. Here, it's 6.\n",
    "* **Mean (Average):**\n",
    "    * To calculate the mean, you need to find the sum of all the data points and divide it by the total number of data points. Since we have frequencies, we multiply each number of times by its frequency, add those results, and then divide by the total number of students.\n",
    "    * First, multiply each number of times by the number of students who practice that many times: (0 \\* 20) + (1 \\* 38) + (2 \\* 16) + (3 \\* 20) + (4 \\* 35) + (5 \\* 5) + (6 \\* 1) = 301\n",
    "    * Then, divide this sum by the total number of students (135): 301 / 135 = 2.23 (approximately). This is the average number of times students practice sports.\n",
    "* **Median:**\n",
    "    * The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order.\n",
    "    * Since we have frequencies, we need to consider them to find the middle position. The total number of students is 135, so the median will be the value corresponding to the (135 + 1) / 2 = 68th student.\n",
    "    * The first 20 students practice 0 times. The next 38 students practice 1 time. The next 16 students practice 2 times.\n",
    "    * Therefore, the 68th student falls into the group that practices 2 times a week. So, the median is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1b) Relationship Between Mean and Median**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The mean (2.23) is greater than the median (2).\n",
    "* When the mean is greater than the median, the distribution is typically skewed to the right (positively skewed). This means there are some higher values that are pulling the average upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2: Real Estate Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Regression Line Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "* We want to find the line that best fits the data points of \"number of properties sold\" and \"number of real estate agents.\" This line is called the regression line.\n",
    "* The equation of a line is generally written as y = mx + b, where:\n",
    "    * y is the dependent variable (number of properties sold).\n",
    "    * x is the independent variable (number of agents).\n",
    "    * m is the slope of the line.\n",
    "    * b is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis).\n",
    "* To find the slope (m) and y-intercept (b), we use calculations based on the means and standard deviations of the two variables, as well as the correlation between them.\n",
    "    1.  Calculate the mean (average) of the number of properties sold.\n",
    "    2.  Calculate the mean (average) of the number of agents.\n",
    "    3.  Calculate the standard deviation (a measure of spread) of the number of properties sold.\n",
    "    4.  Calculate the standard deviation of the number of agents.\n",
    "    5.  Calculate the correlation (a measure of how the two variables are related) between the two variables.\n",
    "    6.  Calculate the slope (m) using the formula: m = correlation \\* (standard deviation of properties sold / standard deviation of agents)\n",
    "    7.  Calculate the y-intercept (b) using the formula: b = (mean of properties sold) - m \\* (mean of agents)\n",
    "* By performing these calculations, we find the slope and y-intercept, which define the line of best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 3: Confidence Interval**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3a) 95% Confidence Interval**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A confidence interval gives us a range within which we believe the true average number of properties sold lies.\n",
    "* Since the data represents a sample, we use the t-distribution.\n",
    "* Here's how to calculate a 95% confidence interval:\n",
    "    1.  Calculate the sample mean (average) of the number of properties sold.\n",
    "    2.  Calculate the sample standard deviation of the number of properties sold.\n",
    "    3.  Determine the t-value. For a 95% confidence level and the appropriate degrees of freedom (related to the sample size), we find the corresponding t-value from a t-table or using statistical software.\n",
    "    4.  Calculate the margin of error: Margin of error = t-value \\* (sample standard deviation / square root of the sample size)\n",
    "    5.  Calculate the confidence interval:\n",
    "        * Lower bound = sample mean - margin of error\n",
    "        * Upper bound = sample mean + margin of error\n",
    "* The result is a range (lower bound, upper bound) within which we are 95% confident the true average number of properties sold lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3b) Effect of Increasing Confidence Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we increase the confidence level to 99%, the confidence interval will become wider.\n",
    "* This is because to be more certain that we capture the true population mean, we need a bigger range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 4: Caloric Intake**\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* We want to test if the average caloric intake of the women is *less than* 7725. This is a one-tailed hypothesis test.\n",
    "* Here's how to do it:\n",
    "    1.  **State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1):**\n",
    "        * H0: The average caloric intake is equal to 7725.\n",
    "        * H1: The average caloric intake is less than 7725.\n",
    "    2.  Calculate the sample mean (average) and sample standard deviation of the given data.\n",
    "    3.  Calculate the t-statistic:\n",
    "        * t = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / square root of sample size)\n",
    "    4.  Find the critical t-value: Since the significance level is 0.05 and it's a left-tailed test, we look up the t-value with the appropriate degrees of freedom from a t-table or using statistical software.\n",
    "    5.  Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical t-value:\n",
    "        * If the calculated t-statistic is less than the critical t-value, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "        * If the calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "    6.  Make a conclusion based on the comparison:\n",
    "        * If we reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that the average caloric intake is significantly less than 7725.\n",
    "        * If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that there is not enough evidence to say the average caloric intake is less than 7725.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 5: Multiple Choice**\n",
    "\n",
    "**5a) Histogram Rectangle Base**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The correct answer is \"l'ampiezza della classe\" (the width of the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "**5b) Double Table Joint Frequencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The correct answer is \"solo se si conosce anche la numerosità complessiva\" (only if the overall number is also known)."
